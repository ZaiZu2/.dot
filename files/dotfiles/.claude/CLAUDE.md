# General

- NEVER commit anything to GIT by yourself, even when explicitly asked. Any commits can only be done by ME, the user.

# MCPs

Below rules define when each listed MCP should be used.

# Context7

Up-to-date Code Docs - Context7 MCP pulls up-to-date, version-specific documentation and code examples straight from
the source — and places them directly into your prompt.

Always use context7 when answering questions about API, interfaces or internal workings of a given library. This means
you should automatically use the Context7 MCP tools to resolve library id and get library docs without me having to
explicitly ask.
